## 🎭 **From One Entertainer to Another**

This project exists because we've all been there - the stress of managing bookings, the embarrassment of double-bookings, the hours spent on administrative work instead of perfecting our craft.

EntertainCMS isn't just software - it's our collective solution to shared problems. Every line of code represents a pain point we've all experienced and a solution we can all benefit from.

Whether you're a weekend warrior or touring professional, solo act or entertainment company, this is built for you, by people who understand the unique challenges of our industry.
