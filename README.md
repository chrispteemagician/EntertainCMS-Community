## 🌟 **What Is EntertainCMS?**

EntertainCMS is a **completely free**, professional-grade booking and contract management system designed specifically for entertainers, performers, and artists. Born from real-world frustration with expensive, bloated software that doesn't understand our industry.

### ✨ **Why This Exists**

As entertainers, we've all been there:
- 📝 **Contract Chaos**: Juggling emails, phone calls, and sticky notes
- 💸 **Expensive Software**: Paying £30-150/month for features we don't need
- 🤹 **Double Bookings**: The nightmare that keeps us awake at night
- 📧 **Unprofessional Communications**: Email chains that make us look amateur

**EntertainCMS solves ALL of this. For free. Forever.**
